Geological Characteristics Prediction for Shield Tunneling Operations
This project focuses on predicting geological characteristics (GC) that are crucial for efficient and safe tunneling operations using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various operational parameters, such as Mean Thrust (MT), Penetration Rate (PR), Field Penetration Index (FPI), Torque Penetration Index (TPI), Advance Rate (AR), Mean Cutterhead Torque (MCT), and Specific Energy (SE). The Extra Trees (ET) algorithm is optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) to enhance its hyperparameters, resulting in a highly accurate model that predicts key geological characteristics related to soil and rock formations.

Key Features:
Dataset: Includes tunneling operational parameters (MT, PR, FPI, TPI, AR, MCT, SE) which are crucial for predicting geological complexities in tunneling.
Applications: This methodology is critical in civil engineering and geotechnical applications for decision-making, ensuring measures are in place to prevent tunnel collapses and hazardous events.
